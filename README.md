# Emulators-433

These are programs that emulate ISM 433MHz-band remote sensing devices.  
They're used to test rtl_433 code (merbanan/rtl_433) on a system that
can receive those transmissions.

So far, tests are provided for:
- Acurite 609THX remote thermometer/hygrometer
- Maverick-et73 smoker dual-thermometer
- Raspi multi-function, general-purpose remote sensor
